# Compilation (.exe)

Targeted machines won´t probably have python and the required libraries installed. 
To run this code on other machines, you need to convert it into an executable.

I recommend the [Pyinstaller library](https://www.pyinstaller.org/).

To use it, simply write these commands in your terminal:
```
pip install pyinstaller
pyinstaller Coalescence.py
```
